BHK is written just as a practise of Haskell and may still contains some bugs as well as no tuning in algorithm is made. But I've found the purely functional programming is quite flexible and powerful tool in developing a kind of automation program such as formula generator, or code generator. BHK is composed of merely five hundred lines of Haskell codes. If you write something like this by using the usual procedural programming language like Python, C++, total file size must become several times larger than BHK program.

BHK may replace my own tensor generator named FEMTO, which is written by using C++ language and is desiged on the basis of object oriented style (MS et. al. J. Chem. Phys. 139, 044118(2013)) in very near future, but for now it's just a sort of study in coding.
